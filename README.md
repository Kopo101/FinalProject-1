FinalProject
============

March 30:
Playing around trying to create menues in TK 

April 5:
All schedule boxes are now hoverable, I made each frame it's own class 
Everything is fully resizeable, might need to adjust minsizes once appointments are in there

Still need:
Need to handle the event where a frame is clicked on 
		-With information:
				Edit current information
		-No information:
				Add a new appointment
Appointment button needs a command as well, currently does nothing
